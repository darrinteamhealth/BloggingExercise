Hello!

I implemented this in .Net 5 because I saw that in the instructions, hope that helps with compatibility if you're running it :)

I used SQLLite for the DB, Gmail for the email provider, and tried to adhere to all the requirements of the exercise as closely as I could. 

I tested both Get and Post endpoints with Postman, and included some comments in the controller at each endpoint. 

There is still an extra endpoint in the controller that I used to test the email functionality, I left that in there so hope that doesn't bother you!

The whole thing runs well from my end, let me know if you have any issues. 

I think the 'allow untrusted apps' for Gmail smtp is changing in May.

Any feedback you have would be great, thanks!
